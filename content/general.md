# How do I do XYZ?
- Try searching google (probably not going to show up but its worth a shot)
- Try using discords jank search feature in the fabric server by searching relavent terms
- Youtube tutorials (like kaupenjoe, but this is very version specific and i dont personally recommend it)
- If its a modding-specific class or term (like `DynamicItemRenderer`), try searching that on github
- Look throught the [fabric discussions tab](https://github.com/orgs/FabricMC/discussions)
- ~~skid~~ learn from other mods source code. need a specific feature? find a mod that does it on modrinth and look at its source code (if its not open source, use [jbytemod from my goat brownie](https://github.com/apkreader/JByteMod-Remastered))
- (LAST RESORT WORKS LIKE 1.3% of the time) Be a proompt slave for ai
